    <h1>The Wee Man from Uist / The High Drive - Alasdair Fraser and Natalie Haas</h1>

    <p>There is a lot to latch on to in Blackpink's <a href="/crazy-over-you">Crazy Over You</a> – they borrow from so many different cultures and genres. I'm choosing to make a connection with the "snapping rhythm" in the chorus that Caleb pointed out.</p>

    <p>The rhythm that makes the chorus so catchy seems to have been inspired by hip-hop but, <a href="https://youtu.be/i7cG9QIvIWo" target="_blank">as noted by Adam Neely</a>, this rhythm is often called a "scotch snap" - it's often found in traditional Scottish music, particularly the strathspey, a dance in 4/4. The Wee Man from Uist is one such strathspey I'm particularly fond of. (The tune has also got a great name - Wee Man from Uist? Just wonderful.) It's paired, as strathspeys often are, with a reel, the High Drive. I enjoy listening to the interplay between the "wee fiddle and the big fiddle" – the varied ways the cello supports the violin as it plays the melody, and vice versa.</p>
