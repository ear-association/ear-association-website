    <h1>Crazy Over You - Blackpink</h1>

    <p>This might be a bit of a jump, but the tonality and texture of <a href="/hare-shiva">Hare Shiva</a> made me think of Crazy Over You by Blackpink.</p>

		The intro is a delightful mix of instruments that I had to look up on Reddit: a plucked Afghan rubab; a cuica; then a bulkan whistle (flute) that plays a line throughout the song. [citation needed here. I basically just got this list from a Reddit thread and verified by looking up the instruments on YouTube.] The drop and the rhythms in the chorus are probably my favorite thing about the piece though. The way she sings "I went crazy over you" is a great, snapping rhythm. The minor seventh in the repetition of "over you, over <strong>you,</strong>" and the little bit of rap in the middle are other highlights for me. Realistically though, I mostly just like listening to it. It feels so easy to move to, the words sound cool, the instruments combine in really cool ways.

		Interestingly, after writing this I've realized both pieces use traditional Indian instruments, but I don't think there was overlap of specific instruments and although I hadn't noticed the connection at first, I notice it now when I hear either piece.

		Crazy Over You was suggested by Caleb deGroot-Maggetti in response to Autorickshaw's <a href="/hare-shiva">Hare Shiva</a>.

		It reminded Jacob of Alasdair Fraser and Natalie Haas's <a href="/wee-man-from-uist">The Wee Man from Uist / The High Drive</a>.
