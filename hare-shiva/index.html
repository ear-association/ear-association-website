    <h1>Hare Shiva - Autorickshaw</h1>

    <p>
		While I listened to <a href="/me-the-machine">Me the Machine</a>, and especially as I watched Imogen Heap's performance of it, I was drawn to the ways she would modify the sound of her voice, pitch shifting here and adding reverb there. This reminded me of the music of Autorickshaw.

		I first heard Hare Shiva when Autorickshaw performed it at a noon-hour concert at Conrad Grebel University College. Though there were only three musicians, by using live sequencing software they achieved a multi-layered sound quite similar to that of the recordings on their album. The effect was quite engaging, and I spent much of the performance trying to relate the sounds coming from the laptop to their original, acoustic sources.

		The melody of Hare Shiva has quite a striking effect. In the first verse, a phrase rises upwards (0:43) and then descends by a half step, the final note bright and glinting. When the verse is repeated, we hear the same rising gesture (1:12), but this time the melody descends by a whole step, the final note now dark and brooding. What a difference a semitone can make!

		It reminded Evy of Andy McKee's <a href="/drifting">Drifting</a>.

		It reminded Caleb of Blackpink's <a href="/crazy-over-you">Crazy Over You</a>.
