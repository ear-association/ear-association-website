	<h1>Passionflower - Jon Gomm</h1>

	<p>
		Listening to a track like <a href="/drifting/">Drifting</a>, and reading Evy's comments on exploring the possibilities inherent in ubiquitous tools and instruments, it was hard to imagine suggesting anything other than Passionflower. It's a video that I find myself coming back to every year or so, whereupon I'll watch it two or three times in a row - it's hard to process all in one go. The music speaks for itself.
