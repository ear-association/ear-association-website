  <h1>Drifting by Andy McKee</h1>

  <p>
    When I listened to the intro to <a href="./hare-shiva">Hare Shiva</a>, I noticed how much I was enjoying the finger picked guitar and rhythmic drumming. I was reminded of my dad playing guitar in the living room with his friends while I was growing up, and in my nostalgia I suddenly remembered a video I stumbled upon a dozen years ago.

    I love listening to this, and especially love watching the coordination with which Andy plays. He sees possibilities in his instrument that I haven't seen conventionally taught or played, such as pressing down the strings from above the neck rather than below, or percussively tapping the strings and body of the guitar. I strive to have such a creative approach in the music I create, and also in the way I interact with tools and my world in general.
