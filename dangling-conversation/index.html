    <h1>The Dangling Conversation - Simon & Garfunkel</h1>
	
	<p>
		Two things made me think of The Dangling Conversation:
		<ol>
			<li>The prominence of acoustic guitar.</li>
		 	<li>The play between major and relative minor and in particular using the V6 chord to approach the I or the vi.</li>
		</ol>
	</p>

    <p>
    	Some things I like about The Dangling Conversation:
		<ol>
			<li>I like the 5 6 7 6 counter melody that comes upon the arrival of the I chord. It gives movement to the I chord and makes it, should I say, dangle for a while.</li>
			<li>Related to 1) â€“ the piece stays on the IV or ii chord most of the piece and whenever the 'dangling conversation' is brought up it is over this relentlessly, unresolved subdominant territory.</li>
			<li>The harmony in the bridge 'only kiss your shadow...' nearly modulates to IV but with some strange alterations to the following chords the arrival to IV still feels 'dangly'. It plummets back into the unresolved territory. Supporting the lyrics which to me seem to describe a serious, deteriorating relationship that is impossible to sort out....</li>
		</ol>
