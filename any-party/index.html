    <h1>Any Party - Feist</h1>

    <p>In Pibroch there's a part (when the band first comes in, and later in the song) with some big chords and messy drum fills. This Feist song has a very similar part, right at the beginning (and also later in the song). It's also got the same time signature in parts.</p>

    <p>What I like about this song: The raw acoustic guitar sound, the chord progressions overall, and I love love love the unexpected A minor (instead of a C major) at 3:52, 3:59, and 4:05. I also love how tightly the band plays, in particular the way the drums fit with the guitar. The song structure feels almost improvised, and yet the band follows along seamlessly. Meanwhile there's a cameo of another song ("Century") from the same album (Pleasure) at 4:39, simulating the sound of leaving the party. Then later another song (the title track) drives by. FWIW, "Century" has a really awesome chord progression.</p>
