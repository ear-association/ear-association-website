    <h1>Teek – Kaki King</h1>

    <p>It was the sound of the mandolin at the beginning of <a href="/the-pleasure-will-be-mine">The Pleasure Will Be Mine</a> that reminded me of Kaki King's Teek: there's something very distinctive about the timbre of the guitar in this track—is it something about the instrument itself that's different from most other guitars? or maybe it's in the reverb that's been added?—that draws me in whenever I listen to it. I also like how so much of the guitar part spends so much time rocking back and forth between two notes: there's a pair of alternating notes in the middle of the guitar's range that runs through much of the track, threaded between the higher and lower lines, and even the piece's melody has lots of back-and-forth to it.</p>
